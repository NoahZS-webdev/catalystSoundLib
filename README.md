Hello! This is the github repository for the Catalyst Center SFX library project.
If you need info about files or just the project in general, it shold be here.
If not, just ask either me (Noah) or Nathan! :)

====================SCOPE====================
This is a website that will be uploaded to the catalyst webserver.
Students will be able to upload and download different audio files from this website.
Currently this project is is it's early stages, however it will gain more functionality over time. eventually users should be able to:

1) Upload and download sounds in both WAV and MP3 form
2) put tags on thier sounds to make it easier to find via searching
3) search sounds by a filter system
4) Make an account
5) Be able to save sounds to a folder/collection unique to that user
6) rate other users' sounds

====================THINGS TO NOTE====================
1) styles.css is the main stylesheet. It encompasses the entire website. If you need to change a css property that is unique to the page you are working on, we ask that you use either an internal stylesheet or direct styling.

2) If you have a large commit, please name it and write a quick description. It makes version control easier and more readable. If its just a few lines of code, don't worry about it.

3) Certain parts of code will be tagged with FIX LATER. If you need to find things that are broken or just aren't done yet, type ctrl+F and search "FIX LATER". That will highlight sections of code that need changes.

4) Pretty please label your code. It makes it easier for other people on the project to read and understand.

5) There is a discord for the project. If you'd like access to it, ask Noah :)

Thanks for reading! Happy Coding. May your duck guide you.
